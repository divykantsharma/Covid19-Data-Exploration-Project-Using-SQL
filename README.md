# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

This project involves the thorough analysis of COVID-19 data utilizing SQL techniques to extract meaningful insights and trends. The main goal of this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's impact on different regions and timeframes.

## Project Overview
The project focuses on employing various SQL techniques to explore and analyze COVID-19 data. It utilizes joins, CTEs, temporary tables, window functions, aggregate functions, and creating views to achieve the following objectives:
•Consolidate data from multiple sources to amalgamate case counts, deaths, and population data.

• Break down complex operations into manageable components using CTEs, enhancing query readability.

• Optimize query performance through temporary tables to reduce redundant calculations.

• Enhance reusability by creating a view named "PercentPopulationVaccinated" for vaccination percentage calculations.
## Tools Used
• Microsoft SQL Server 2019

• Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
## Project Structure
Contains a series of SQL queries that explore various aspects of the COVID-19 data. Each query addresses a specific analysis objective, demonstrating different SQL techniques.
## Usage
1. Install Microsoft SQL Server 2019 and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio if not already installed.
2. Execute the SQL queries in queries.sql using SQL Server Management Studio or a preferred SQL client.
3. The queries perform various analyses on the provided COVID-19 datasets, generating insights and trends.
